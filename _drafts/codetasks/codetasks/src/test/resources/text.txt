We passed upon the stair
he spoke in was and when
although I wasn't there
he said I was his friend
which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
a long long time ago

Oh no not me
we never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
and made my way back home
I searched for former land
for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare
with more than millions here
I must have died alone
a long long time ago

Who knows not me
I never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world

Who knows not me
we never lost control
you're face to face
with the man who sold the world
